Findings:
- The number of new COVID-19 Cases are increasing at an exponential rate.
- Whilst China was reaching its apex, the rest of the world was slowly increasing at an exponential rate.
- Politcal decisions and the way countries report its data play significant roles in the increase of new cases.
- At the time of the release of this data, not all countries are hit equally and should observe the rate it is affecting countries such as Italy, Iran, and South Korea.
